Agentic AI systems are defined by their ability to perceive context, plan actions, and use tools to meet goals. Unlike classic pipelines, agent frameworks allow for dynamic adaptation. The autonomy spectrum ranges from simple prompted assistants to complex multi-agent systems. Agentic design is most beneficial for dynamic tasks with incomplete information. Core components include goals, memory, tool access, and planning policies.
